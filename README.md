# POLYTECHNIC
## BY MERIDIAN WEAPONWORKS
In Polytechnic, you play as an employee at the Steampunk weapons building company, Meridian Weaponworks. One day on the job as a janitor, you are selected by the boss of the company to take on the weapons tester position, and gladly accept the promotion. 

You enter the test chamber and begin testing weapon combinations. However, as you progress, you realize that something is off about the boss; something else has taken over the facility, and is using you to test their concepts for their ultimate doomsday weapon. 

While originally you were making weapons for them, now you are making them for yourself: to create the strongest weapon to dispose of the threat that has taken over, before they use the facility to create a weapon to end the world.

VISUAL STYLE: Eclectic steampunk pixel art platformer, becomes more run-down and dangerous as it goes on, very kit-bashed look to a lot of the designs/world

SOUNDSCAPE: Busy and intense, lots of action and fast movement. Action-packed and loud when in combat, with out-of-combat moments feeling like a sigh of relief.
